                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates found across Africa, Asia, and Central and South America.
                        They are divided into two main categories: Old World monkeys, which inhabit Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys, native to Central and South America. Old World monkeys, such as baboons and macaques, typically have narrow, downward-facing nostrils and non-prehensile tails, while New World monkeys, like capuchins and howler monkeys, often possess flatter noses and prehensile tails adapted for grasping.
                        Monkeys vary greatly in size and appearance, from the tiny pygmy marmoset, weighing about 100 grams, to the large mandrill, which can weigh up to 36 kilograms. 
                        They are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and ability to use tools. Most monkeys are diurnal and arboreal, spending much of their time in trees, although some species are terrestrial.
                        Their diets are omnivorous, including fruits, leaves, seeds, and small animals. Monkeys communicate using vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language, and they live in social groups that can range from small family units to large troops.
                        Conservation status varies among species; some, like the proboscis monkey, are endangered due to habitat loss and hunting, while others, such as the rhesus macaque, are more widespread and adaptable.
                        Monkeys play crucial roles in their ecosystems, including seed dispersal and maintaining the balance of their habitats.</p>
