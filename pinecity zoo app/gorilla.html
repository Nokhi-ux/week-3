                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas (Gorilla) are the largest living primates and share approximately 98.3% of their DNA with humans, making them our closest relatives after chimpanzees and bonobos. These intelligent and social animals inhabit the tropical forests of central and western Africa.
                       Gorillas primarily inhabit tropical and subtropical forests, ranging from lowland swamps to montane cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters.
                       Gorillas live in groups called troops, typically led by a dominant male known as a silverback. These groups consist of several females and their offspring. Troops can range in size from 5 to over 50 individuals. Silverbacks are responsible for the group's safety and decision making</p>
