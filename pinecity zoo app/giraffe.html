                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest land mammals on Earth, renowned for their long necks, distinctive coat patterns, and gentle demeanor. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, they inhabit savannas and open woodlands, where they play a crucial role in their ecosystems.
                       Height: Adult giraffes can reach heights of 14 to 19 feet (4.3 to 5.8 meters), with males typically being taller than females.
                       Weight: They weigh between 1,750 and 2,800 pounds (800 to 1,270 kilograms).
                       Neck and Legs: Their long necks and legs allow them to browse foliage in treetops that few other animals can reach.
                       Tongue: Giraffes possess a prehensile tongue that can extend up to 21 inches (53 cm), aiding in grasping leaves from branches.
                       Coat Patterns: Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern, which helps in identification and camouflage among trees.</p>
