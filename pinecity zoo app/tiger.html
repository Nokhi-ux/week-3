                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest wild cats, native to Asia, with populations primarily in India, Russia, and Southeast Asia.
                        They inhabit diverse environments, including tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps, grasslands, and temperate forests.
                        Tigers are apex predators, mainly hunting large ungulates like deer and wild boar, and are known for their solitary nature and territorial behavior.
                        They communicate through vocalizations, scent marking, and physical markings. Typically, female tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years, with high juvenile mortality rates.
                        Tigers have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years in the wild, reaching up to 20 years in captivity. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect tigers from threats such as poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict.
                        These efforts include establishing protected areas, anti-poaching measures, and community engagement programs. Despite these initiatives, tigers remain endangered due to ongoing challenges and require continued conservation attention.</p>
