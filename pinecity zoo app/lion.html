                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are large, social carnivores native to sub-Saharan Africa and a small population in India's Gir Forest.
                        They are unique among big cats for their social structure, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their offspring, and one or a few adult males. 
                        These prides can range from 5 to 30 individuals and have well-defined territories that they defend using vocalizations and scent markings. Lions are apex predators and hypercarnivores, primarily hunting large herbivores such as wildebeests, zebras, and buffaloes.
                        Lionesses usually do the hunting, employing coordinated strategies to bring down prey, while males often defend the pride's territory and may scavenge from other predators. A lion's roar can be heard up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) away and serves to communicate with pride members and warn intruders. 
                        They are most active at dawn and dusk, resting for up to 21 hours a day. Lions reproduce sexually, with females giving birth to one to four cubs after a gestation period of about 110 days. Cubs are born blind and spotted, and their survival rate is low, with about 80% dying before reaching adulthood. 
                        Those that survive can live up to 10â€“14 years in the wild. Lions face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, leading to a vulnerable conservation status. 
                        Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and community engagement to ensure the survival of this iconic species.</p>
