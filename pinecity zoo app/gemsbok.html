                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a striking and resilient antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. Known for their impressive horns and remarkable adaptations to desert life, gemsbok are among the most iconic species of the oryx genus.
                        Size: Gemsbok stand about 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall at the shoulder. Males typically weigh between 230 and 250 kg (500â€“550 lbs), while females are slightly lighter at around 200 kg (440 lbs).
                        Coloration: Their coats are light taupe to tan with distinctive black and white markings on the face, legs, and rump. The tail is long and black, complementing their striking appearance.
                        Horns: Both males and females possess long, straight horns that can reach up to 120 cm (47 inches). Males' horns are generally thicker and more curved, while females' horns are slightly longer and thinner. These horns are used for defense against predators and in territorial disputes</p>
