                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas are two distinct bear species native to Asia: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the red panda (Ailurus fulgens). 
                        The giant panda is primarily found in the mountainous regions of central China, inhabiting temperate forests at elevations between 1,200 and 3,500 meters. 
                        It is known for its black-and-white fur and a diet that consists almost entirely of bamboo, consuming up to 28 pounds daily. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have a digestive system adapted to a bamboo diet, relying on rapid digestion to process the large quantities needed.
                        They are solitary animals, with each maintaining a home range of 3 to 7 square miles. Breeding occurs in the spring, with females ovulating only once a year, and cubs are born small and helpless, requiring extensive maternal care. 
                        Conservation efforts have led to a population increase, and the species was reclassified from "endangered" to "vulnerable" by the IUCN.</p>
