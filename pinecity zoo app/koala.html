                    <h3>INSECT-HOUSE</h3>
                    <p>Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are iconic Australian marsupials, often mistakenly called "koala bears," though they are not bears.
                       These tree-dwelling animals are primarily found in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. Koalas have thick, woolly fur that ranges from grey to brown, with white patches on their chest, inner arms, ears, and bottom.
                       They possess a large, black nose and large, round ears, contributing to their distinctive appearance. Koalas are well adapted for life in the trees, with sharp claws for climbing. They can sleep for up to 18-20 hours a day and are most active at night (nocturnal). 
                       Koalas have a specialized diet of almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves (folivore). They are so particular that out of Australia’s 600 types of eucalyptus tree species, they are known to only eat the leaves of about 30 of these species! What’s even more unique, is that eucalyptus leaves are toxic to most animals due to their high level of phenolic compounds.
                       But koalas have specialized adaptations that allow them to break down toxins in the leaves. One of the key adaptations is specialized genes expressed in the liver.</p>
