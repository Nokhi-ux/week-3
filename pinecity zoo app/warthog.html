                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are robust, pig-like mammals native to sub-Saharan Africa, typically inhabiting savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.
                        Distinguished by their prominent facial warts—protective pads rather than true warts—and long tusks, warthogs are well-adapted to their environments. 
                        They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and occasionally small animals or carrion. Warthogs are known for their unique behavior of kneeling on their calloused front knees while grazing, a posture that allows them to feed on short grasses efficiently.
                        They often use burrows, typically abandoned by aardvarks, for shelter, entering them tail-first to face potential threats. Socially, warthogs live in groups called sounders, led by females and consisting of their offspring; males tend to be solitary or form bachelor groups.
                        Breeding occurs seasonally, with females giving birth to litters of up to eight piglets after a gestation period of about six months. Despite their somewhat comical appearance, warthogs are swift runners, capable of reaching speeds up to 55 km/h (34 mph) when threatened.
                        While they face threats from predators like lions and hyenas, warthogs are classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN due to their widespread distribution and adaptability. However, they are still vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting pressures in certain regions. 
                        Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection and maintaining healthy populations across their range.</p>
