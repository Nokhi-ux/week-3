                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth, known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and distinctive features such as trunks and tusks. There are three recognized species:
                       African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana): The largest, found across sub-Saharan Africa.
                       African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis): Smaller and more elusive, inhabiting Central and West African forests.
                       Asian elephant (Elephas maximus): Smaller than their African relatives, native to South and Southeast Asia.
                       Elephants are highly social animals with complex behaviors. African elephants typically live in matriarchal herds led by the oldest female, while males leave the herd upon reaching maturity.
                       Asian elephants also form tight-knit family groups.
                       They communicate through vocalizations, body language, and infrasound, and are known to exhibit empathy, mourning, and cooperation.</p>
